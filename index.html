            ### Project Overview 

            The goal of my project is to reduce the amount of waste produced surrounding my food consumption. The first step of this project was to track my food waste for a week. I then analyzed the data and found the most common sources of waste. I then created a plan to reduce the waste produced by these sources. I then implemented the plan and tracked the results.

              ### Caveats and Assumptions

              - Not intrested in switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet
                - Volume of meat free food required to meet protein requirements is too high
                - 19g of protein per 100g of chickpeas
                - 31g of protein per 100g of chicken breast
              - Diet is not focused on weight loss
              - Diet prioritizes high protein (more than 230g per day)
